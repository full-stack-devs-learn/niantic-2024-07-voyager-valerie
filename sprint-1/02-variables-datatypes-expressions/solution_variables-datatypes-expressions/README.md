# Variables, Datatypes and Expressions

This exercise lays the foundation of programming in java. You will learn to store 
data in variables so that you can use it later in your code.

Java is a strongly typed language, which means that you must define what data type
each variable will hold.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand how to:

* Execute a java project 
* Declare variables with meaningful names
* Specify the correct data types for your variables
* Use java expressions

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must compile (it cannot have any build errors).
* Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive.
* Variables must have the correct data types.
* Calculations should use variables - no `magic numbers`
* Code must be clean and properly formatted (indentations and white space).

## Getting started

1. Open the `exercises_variables-datatypes-expressions` project in IntelliJ.
2. Open `Main.java` in the `src/main/java` folder.
3. Follow the instructions in the `Main.java` file.
    * Use the code in the `examples()` function as a guide.
4. Click the `Play` button to test your code.

## Tips and tricks

### Solve the problem on paper

You should know what problem you are solving before you write any code. Make sure that you
can calculate the solution on paper first.


### Don't linger too long on one problem

If you find yourself stuck on a problem more than fifteen minutes, move on to the next, and try again later. You may figure out the solution after working through another problem or two.
