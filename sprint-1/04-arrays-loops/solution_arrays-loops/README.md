# Arrays and Loops

In this chapter you learned about arrays as data structures. You also 
learned about loops.

In these exercise you will solidify these concepts by performing 
common programming tasks like creating new arrays, adding items
to an array, looping through all elements of an array.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand:

* What an array is and why we use them to manage variables
* How to create a new array
* The different types of loops available to you in Java
* How to loop through all elements of an array

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must compile (it cannot have any build errors).
* Unit tests must pass. (Your programming logic must be correct)
* Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive.
* Use arrays and loops to solve the exercises (you don't always need both)
* Code must be clean and properly formatted (indentations and white space).

## Getting started

1. Open the `exercises_arrays-loops` project in IntelliJ.
2. Right-click the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
3. Review the `test runner` tab to view a list of the failing tests.
4. Open the `src/main/java/com/niantic/Exercises` class and follow 
   the instructions to complete each function.
4. Re-run the Unit Tests as you make changes to your code to see if they pass.
5. Complete one function/test at a time.

## Tips and tricks

### Solve the problem on paper

Spend time brainstorming each problem and write out the workflow on paper. This will 
help you to understand the big picture.

You should know what problem you are solving before you write any code. Make sure that you
can calculate the solution on paper first. Use a notepad to calculate the answer. Create a 
diagram or flowchart of what the logic should be.


### Don't linger too long on one problem

If you find yourself stuck on a problem more than fifteen minutes, move on to the next, and 
try again later. You may figure out the solution after working through another problem or two.
