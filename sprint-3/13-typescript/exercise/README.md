# Review Exercise + Working with TypeScript

This Review Exercise is not graded. The first priority is to get caught up on existing assignments.

## Working with TypeScript

This exercise is to get you to start working with TypeScript. One of the best ways
to do this is to convert a project that you have completed to using typescript.

### Option 1
Convert your existing Northwind React project to using TypeSript.

* Create a copy of your project
* Install TypeScript and other references
  `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom`
* Add the tsconfig.json files (copy the files from this exercise folder)
* Convert all jsx files to tsx files
* Convert all js files to ts files
* Add a models folder and create classes/models for Category and Product

### Option 2
Create a new Northind React Project and use TypeScript

```bash
npx create-vite northwind-react-ts
```
* Rebuild the project and componets but use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
* Add a models folder and create classes/models for Category and Product


### Option 3
Create a new Star Wars or Pokemon Project and use TypeScript

```bash
npx create-vite star-wars-react-ts
npx create-vite pokemon-react-ts
```
* Rebuild the project using React componets and TypeScript instead of JavaScript
* Add a models folder and create classes/models for Category and Product
