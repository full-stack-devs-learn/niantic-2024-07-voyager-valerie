3.	With each order Claire needs to generate 
	a receipt to print for the customer
	and to store for her records.

	The receipt must include this information

	Customer name
	quantity (# of cookies in dozens)
	Subtotal
	Tax
	Total

	When a customer places an they specify their
	name, and the quantity of cookies that they 
	want to order (in dozens)

	The place order function should perform all
	calculations and return the receipt in 
	JavaScript object format as follows:

	placeOrder("Sean", 1) =>	{
									customer: "Sean"
									quantity: 1,
									subtotal: 12.95,
									tax: .74,
									total: 13.69

									customer: "Sean"
									quantity: 2,
									subtotal: 25.90,

	depends on their current grade in Sean's class.

	A students = 4 cookies
	B students = 3 cookies
	everyone else 2 cookies
