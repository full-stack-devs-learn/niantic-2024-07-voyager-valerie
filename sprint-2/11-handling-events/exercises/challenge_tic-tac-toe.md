# Challenge - Tic-Tac-Toe

Use the starter code in the challenge_tic-tac-toe folder to create an interactive tic-tac-toe game.

You will need to keep track of the current player, and display their name. When the player clicks a square, mark it as either X or O depending on which player's turn it is.

In this exercise you do not need to dynamically declare a winner, you just need to allow the players to play the game.
