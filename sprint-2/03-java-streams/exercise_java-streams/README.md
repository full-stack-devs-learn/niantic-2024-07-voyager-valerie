# Working with Java Streams

In this chapter you learned how to manipulate collections using the 
Java Streams API. In this exercise you will use Java Streams to 
filter, map, aggregate and sort data that did not come from a database.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand:

* How to use common Java Stream functions to work with collections
* How to filter datasets
* How to use map() to transform dataset into different "shapes"
* How to use reduce() to aggregate data
* How to use distinct() to remove duplicate values
* How to use sorted() to order your collections


## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must compile (it cannot have any build errors).
* **Required**
  * Filters unit tests must pass
  * Maps unit tests must pass
* **Optional / Challenge** 
  * Reducers unit tests should pass

## Getting started

1. Open the `com.niantic.exercises` package and locate the `Filters` class.
2. Complete logic required by each function to filter the input List.
   * You should use Java Streams functions to complete the exercise
3. Run the unit tests to verify that your logic is correct
   * You can also run the application and verify that your code works
