# Polymorphism

In this exercise, you will load student data from csv text files.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand how to:

* Open a file stream to read text files.
* Work with Exceptions to gracefully handle runtime errlrs

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must compile (it cannot have any build errors).
* The application must display the correct information on the screen

## Getting started

1. Open the `exercise_file-io-exceptions` project in IntelliJ.
2. Open the `todo` navigation window and complete the numbered todo tasks

## Tips and tricks

### Focus on one test at a time

As you work on creating the classes, be sure to run the tests, and then provide enough code to pass the test. For instance, if you're working on the `Order` class, provide enough code to get one of the `Order` tests passing.

Focusing on getting a single test to pass at a time saves time, as this forces you to only focus on what's important for the test you're currently working on. This is commonly called **[Test Driven Development][introduction-to-test-driven-development]**, or **TDD**.

### Don't linger too long on one problem

If you find yourself stuck on a problem more than fifteen minutes, move on to the next, and try again later. You may figure out the solution after working through another problem or two.

# Exercises
