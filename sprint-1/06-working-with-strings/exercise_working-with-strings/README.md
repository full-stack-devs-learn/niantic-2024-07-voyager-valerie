# Working with Strings

In this chapter you learned that Strings are not primitive data types.
Strings 

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand how to:

* Use the common String methods
    - `substring()`
    - `toUppercase()` and `toLowercase()`
    - `trim()` and `strip()`
    - `equals("other")` and `equalsIgnoreCase("OtHeR")`
    - etc
* Use built-in String formatting
    - `String.format()` patterns
    - `System.out.printf()`

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must compile. (it cannot have any build errors)
* Unit tests must pass. (Your programming logic must be correct)
* Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive.
* Code must be clean and properly formatted. (indentations and white space)

## Getting started

1. Open the `exercises_arrays-loops` project in IntelliJ.
2. Right-click the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
3. Review the `test runner` tab to view a list of the failing tests.
4. Open the `src/main/java/com/niantic/Exercises` class and follow 
   the instructions to complete each function.
4. Re-run the Unit Tests as you make changes to your code to see if they pass.
5. Complete one function/test at a time.

## Tips and tricks

### Solve the problem on paper

Spend time brainstorming each problem and write out the workflow on paper. This will 
help you to understand the big picture.

You should know what problem you are solving before you write any code. Make sure that you
can calculate the solution on paper first. Use a notepad to calculate the answer. Create a 
diagram or flowchart of what the logic should be.


### Don't linger too long on one problem

If you find yourself stuck on a problem more than fifteen minutes, move on to the next, and 
try again later. You may figure out the solution after working through another problem or two.
