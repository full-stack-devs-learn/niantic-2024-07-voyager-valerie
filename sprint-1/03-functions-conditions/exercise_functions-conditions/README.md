# Functions and Conditions

summary

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand how to:

* Break your logic into reusable functions
* Use `if` statements to make decisions in code
* Use `switch` statements as an alternative to `if`
* Use java expressions

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must compile (it cannot have any build errors).
* Unit tests must pass.
* Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive.
* Variables must have the correct data types.
* Code must be clean and properly formatted (indentations and white space).

## Getting started

1. Open the `exercises_functions-conditions` project in IntelliJ.
2. Right-click the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
3. Review the `test runner` tab to view a list of the failing tests.
4. Open the `src/main/java/com/niantic/BackyardBasketball` class and follow 
   the instructions to complete each function.
4. Re-run the Unit Tests as you make changes to your code to see if they pass.
5. Complete one function/test at a time.

## Tips and tricks

### Solve the problem on paper

You should know what problem you are solving before you write any code. Make sure that you
can calculate the solution on paper first. Use a notepad to calculate the answer. Create a 
diagram or flowchart of what the logic should be.


### Don't linger too long on one problem

If you find yourself stuck on a problem more than fifteen minutes, move on to the next, and try again later. You may figure out the solution after working through another problem or two.
