# Exercise - Introduction to React Components

In this exercise you will work with an Existing React page, and you will break the page into smaller components like we did in the class exercise.

## Step 1 - Plan your components

* Look at the page and plan what components you will need
* Create the folder and file structure for your components

## Step 2 - Create the components

* Start with the header
* Then for the employee components, work from the outside in
    * Employee Page first
    * Employee Row last

## Step 3 - Use props to pass data

The Employee Row object needs information about what to display.

Props could include:
* First Name
* Last Name
* Id
* Title

## Optional - Step 4 - Use Click Events

Add a Click event to the Employee div. When a user clicks the employe
you should display the employee details on the main page

Employee details may include
* Larger Picture
* Full Name
* Title
* Salary
* Notes
